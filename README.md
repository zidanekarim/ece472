# ECE472 Starter Repository

This repository provides the development environment, baseline templates, and submission tooling for programming assignments in **ECE472 (Deep Learning)** at The Cooper Union. It uses a pure-Python workflow managed with `uv`, task automation via `just`, modular Flax NNX / JAX package templates, and an automated HTML submission generator with embedded vector SVG plots.


## Platform Requirements

All assignments are designed for local CPU execution via `jax[cpu]`. Supported operating systems:

- **Linux**: Supported natively out of the box.
- **macOS (Apple Silicon & Intel)**: Supported natively.
- **Windows**: **WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) is required.** JAX does not distribute native Windows wheels. Install WSL2 via PowerShell (`wsl --install`), launch an Ubuntu shell, clone the repository within WSL, and follow the Linux instructions below.

## Environment Setup

### 1. Install Required Tooling

The workflow requires three system-level tools:

1. **`uv`** (Python package and environment manager):
   - macOS / Linux / WSL2:
     ```bash
     curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
     ```
   - macOS (Homebrew): `brew install uv`
   - Additional installation methods: [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

2. **`just`** (Command runner):
   - macOS: `brew install just`
   - Linux / WSL2: `sudo apt install just` or `cargo install just`
   - Additional installation methods: [just documentation](https://just.systems/man/en/pre-built-binaries.html).

3. **`pango`** (Native C library for automated PDF compilation via `just submission`):
   - macOS (Homebrew): `brew install pango`
   - Linux / WSL2: `sudo apt install libpango-1.0-0 libpangoft2-1.0-0 libharfbuzz-subset0`

## Assignment Lifecycle

Each assignment follows a standardized workflow:

### 1. Scaffold a New Assignment
```bash
just new hw01
```
Generates a new, independent Python package in `hw01/` via Copier with typed configuration (`config.toml`), synthetic data loading, Flax NNX module scaffolding, training loop, and SVG plotting routines. The command immediately executes the scaffolded project to verify the environment.

### 2. Implement and Run
```bash
just run hw01
```
Executes the assignment entry point (`hw01:main`) inside its dedicated virtual environment. Training metrics stream to stdout, and output figures are written to `hw01/artifacts/` as vector SVGs.

To run with debug logging:
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG just run hw01
```

### 3. Check Code Quality and Types
```bash
just check hw01
```
Runs code formatting checks (`ruff format --check`), linter diagnostics (`ruff check`), and static type analysis (`ty check`).

### 4. Compile Submission Reports (HTML & PDF)
```bash
# Generate both HTML and PDF submission reports:
just submission hw01
```

Automatically formats source files with `ruff`, verifies static type safety with `ty`, and compiles submission documents in the dedicated, git-ignored `submissions/` directory (`submissions/hw01.html` and `submissions/hw01.pdf`).

The submission report includes:
- Deterministic module ordering (`pyproject.toml`, `config.toml`, `README.md`, followed by package source files and output plots).
- Running headers on every printed/PDF page containing your student name, Cooper Union email, homework title, and page numbering.
- Syntax-highlighted source code with line numbering.
- Collapsible file sections for interactive grading review.
- Inline vector SVG figures with selectable, scalable text.
### 5. Digital and Hard-Copy Submission
- **Digital Submission**: Submit the generated `submissions/hw01.html` through the course submission portal.
- **Printed Hard Copy**: Print the generated `submissions/hw01.pdf` for in-person physical submission.

## Engineering Conventions

### Adding Dependencies
Each homework directory is an independent Python package. Add external dependencies using `uv add`:

```bash
# From the repository root:
uv add scikit-learn --project hw01

# Or from within the homework directory:
cd hw01 && uv add scikit-learn
```

Always use `uv add` instead of `pip install` to ensure `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` remain synchronized.

### Typed Configuration (`config.toml`)
Settings are declared via `pydantic-settings` models in `config.py` and loaded from `config.toml`:

```toml
debug = false
random_seed = 31415

[data]
num_features = 1
num_samples = 50

[training]
batch_size = 16
learning_rate = 0.1
```

### Vector Plotting Standards
When creating figures with Matplotlib, save vector SVG files with text preserved as text elements rather than paths:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.rcParams["svg.fonttype"] = "none"

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y)
plt.savefig("artifacts/my_plot.svg")
plt.close(fig)
```

### Structured Logging
Assignments use `structlog` for structured, key-value console logging:

```python
import structlog

log = structlog.get_logger()
log.info("Training started", batch_size=16, lr=0.01)
log.debug("Model state", weights=w)
```
